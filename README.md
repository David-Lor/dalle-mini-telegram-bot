## Features

- Request from Telegram, return the 9 pictures result as an album
- Status report while the images are being generated (the bot sends a 'typing-like' status to the user, until all its requests are completed)
- If the server is too busy, keep retrying until success (or timeout)

The bot is deployed here: [https://telegram.me/dalle_mini_bot](https://telegram.me/dalle_mini_bot)
